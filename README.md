# Web-Design-Challenge

In this project, I used data from my Python-API project on weather patterns near the equator to create an online project display. View initial data analysis on [my GitHub](https://github.com/MaxBrowning/python-api-challenge "Python API Challenge").

To complete the project, I utilized HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Juypter Notebook. The project responds to different screen sizes using a combination of media queries and Bootstrap grids. Finally, the project was deployed using GitHub.
